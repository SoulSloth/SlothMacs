My current personal Emacs configuration. Everything is subject to change always.

Literate configuration can be found in the [[./Emacs.org][Emacs.org]] file

* 🐃Principles
Like all custom configs, this one is opinionated toward the preferences of the users, and I roughly follow these guidelines:

** 🎸 Chords Suck
I do not like key chords and will remap frequently used commands to sequences wherever possible. The war against RSI is a long one.

** 📈 Constant Improvement
The config will never be /"good enough"/ , there will always be something to improve, try, and fix. 

** 🪓 Simplicity of Config
Currently I have one file to edit, [[./Emacs.org][Emacs.org]], and I intend to keep it that way for as long as possible! 

** 🧩System Ubiquity
Things should work the same across my Arch laptop, Macbook, and Windows desktop. 

* 🤔 Thoughts On Tools and Workflows
Some of my current ideas around tooling and workflows. 

** 📸 Org Capture
[[file:Emacs.org::Capture Templates][My Capture templates]] are my current way to take notes and plan my day.
- Noting significant daily occurrences like blockers, task completions, and insights is pretty powerful.
- Current planning scheme revolves around a date-tree with a =Plan= bullet and a capture template for the happenings of the day under it. Linking tickets/slack messages/docs that I know I'll have to use the night before makes doing that work a little easier and provides it for faster lookup if I ever need to recall something specific.
- Journaling has been a pretty nice experience so far for brain-dumping and refining plans for the next day.
